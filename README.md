## Problem:

Design APIs to travel all solutions, which are met the requirements of all
limitations.

- Support to add variables with name.
- Support to add variables with varargs.
- Support to add limitations for collection.
- Support to travel all solutions.

You should implement follow functions:
```
- add_variable(name, val, ...)
- add_limit(func)
- travel_solution(func)
```

We implement a demo for this problem, but it just a demo. You **should NOT** be
restricted by this demo.


### Limitation;

**Limit 1**

The type of variables is Int.

**Limtt 2**

You can suppose all limits don't have bugs.


## Requirement:

- Use git to manage your codes.
- Obey linux-kernel coding style.
- Create a unit test for regression.
